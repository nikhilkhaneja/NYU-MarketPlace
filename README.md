### PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
The idea is to build a marketplace for NYU students. The two roles that the user can take are that of a Buyer and a Seller. The buyer can login, search for the items to buy, and bid on the items on the bidding market. The seller can post the item and set a price or can put it on the bidding market (as his preference).
